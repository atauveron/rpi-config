# RPi-config

Configuration files and miscellaneous scripts for my Raspberry Pi (running Raspbian)

## .zshrc

I use zsh with the [oh-my-zsh](http://ohmyz.sh/) framework and the [oh-my-via](https://github.com/badouralix/oh-my-via) theme.

## bootstrap.sh

This bootstrap script installs a few useful packages, as well as the zsh shell, and the [oh-my-zsh](http://ohmyz.sh/) framework with the [oh-my-via](https://github.com/badouralix/oh-my-via) theme. It also deploys the `.zshrc` file automatically.

## dhcpcd.conf

Configuration file to use a static IP address.

## iptables

Simple IPv4 rules, for accepting connections from a local network (`192.168.0.0/16`) and dropping everything else. No IPv6 support (everything is dropped).

Load the rules with `iptables-restore < rules.v4` and `ip6tables-restore < rules.v6`.

## fail2ban

Fail2ban configuration files, for protection against DoS attacks through ssh.
